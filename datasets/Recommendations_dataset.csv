emphasising more the learning aspect and give less importance to the final exam maybe increasing the relevance of practical assignments,assessment
The metrics are useful tools for process monitoring and assessment for beginners in a controlled course project context,assessment
Our viable design choices for automated assessment: external test case deployment using container technology validation through user interface input/output service configuration through chained property files and finally fine-grained inspection through a special logging mechanism,assessment
We are working on automated prechecking of students’ submissions,assessment
we need also to think to teach validation and verification techniques pushing more them at runtime to continuously assess the evolved system,assessment
We decided to develop of a questionnaire that would uncover some insights about the team,classes preparation
It is important to get in advance as much information as possible about the audience,classes preparation

build a Software Engineering curricula on the backbone derived from the DevOps philosophy,curriculum
In an SE course DevOps could be addressed through two forms: the first form is treating DevOps as a different kind of development This form could happen early in the course where almost no additional background is required The second form emphasizes the Ops part which is not typically addressed by SE teachers ,curriculum
It is therefore necessary establishing clear connections of every course with DevOps,curriculum
DevOps should be proper course in the curriculum ,curriculum
One way to achieve motivation is by making the course optional,curriculum
Use DevOps course as a prerequisite for some specialization course to deliver to students specialized skills,curriculum
we outlining a course focusing on hybrid skills,curriculum
Development than Operations presented the two sides as interrelated strengthen the knowledge and increase efficacy,curriculum
DevOps course should be two courses: first course IaC and basic automation and the second one to cover CI and CD,curriculum
continuous delivery improve learning software testing,curriculum
Curriculum should couple Architecture to DevOps because both approaches complement each other,curriculum
we need to introduce courses on learning and adaptation theories algorithms and tools before DevOps course,curriculum
DevOps course needs time to teach (three weeks in 125 hours for summer course),curriculum
instructors should make note of the amount of time that it will take for them to setup for the lab,curriculum
It is therefore necessary describing how fundamental knowledge works within the frame of this philosophy,devops concepts
the course must focus on the concepts and use tools only as an illustration,devops concepts
It is therefore necessary to explain students the DevOps values from scratch,devops concepts
It may be useful to intensify the theoretical delivery ,devops concepts
the course should teach theoretical concepts using shared project before lab assignments,devops concepts
to introduce all principles and pillars of DevOps earlier together with basic realizations for each part so that they can be applied to the project,devops concepts
Both authors have multidisciplinary and pedagogical background and working experience in higher education,devops concepts
The pipeline used was designed to help instructors introduce continuous integration and delivery into preexisting courses and allow students to visually understand the processes of continuous delivery and continuous integration,devops concepts
without our automated deployment pipeline the customer feedback would not have been possible in such an easy way,devops concepts
To cover the ”Ops” part we need to teach how to engineer innovative software systems that can react to changes and new needs properly without compromising the effectiveness of the system and without imposing cumbersome a priori analyses,devops concepts
An application which is suitable for learners to serve as a means for setting up a deployment pipeline is presented,environment setup
running the servers as a service is more straightforward on consecutive days,environment setup
when setting up for independent labs the instructor leads the class through the setup process,environment setup
automated scripts save significant time to setting up each student's repository,environment setup
Cloud DevOps platforms allow teams to take advantage of DevOps processes without having to invest their own effort in the integration of the necessary tools,environment setup
project-based teaching has proved to be successful as knowledge transfer mechanism,pedagogy
project-based teaching blended with traditional lectures and tutoring sessions has already proved to be successful as knowledge transfer mechanism,pedagogy
Assigning the same project to every group,pedagogy
a more detailed initial project description would be provided to each student,pedagogy
even if the course is project-driven students need personal assistance,pedagogy
we design projects representing different customer types architecture styles and techniques,pedagogy
we collaborate with various partners representing customers from industry as well as on-campus organizations on project design,pedagogy
the key success factors is the cross-project release management team,pedagogy
to introduce diversities into the design of course projects,pedagogy
a good practice was turns around “small steps”,pedagogy
Be clear on the outcome of the training,pedagogy
in particular a clear description of the technical-related objectives to be met,pedagogy
Create the easygoing and trusting atmosphere amongst the students and the teachers,pedagogy
DevOps is the ideal candidate for non-traditional ways of teaching such as peer instructions flipped classroom problem-based learning among others,pedagogy
Problem-based learning (PBL) method is the right pedagogical approach to tackle subjects like DevOps,pedagogy
DevOps needs to be taught with practical labs,pedagogy
To simulate real-life software engineering the labs must be defined thanks to an open and informal specification expressed in business terms and it will be up to the students to design the right architecture implement it in an iterative way and support its deployment thanks to a continuous delivery pipeline,pedagogy
the practical and theoretical days would be mixed ,pedagogy
making the revision part more interactive and student-centered,pedagogy
We devised a customized Agile process to encourage both online and offline communication and collaboration ,pedagogy
request students to work in groups,pedagogy
the course had to be designed to favour interactivity and student engagement,pedagogy
teaching methods that emphasize programing process and realistic context as well as using performant virtualization environments,pedagogy
Using a cross functional team to introduce the workflows minimizes the additional work for the teaching assistants,pedagogy
try to bring industry partners into the course,pedagogy
the design and execution of a DevOps and Continuous Delivery course organized in industry-university collaboration,pedagogy
the most effective training for DevOps and Agile were those in which the audience consisted of both management and developers,pedagogy
The primary objective is to educate DevOps ambassadors,pedagogy
training is of paramount importance to establish a common background for all the different groups including the management,pedagogy
it is important not to focus all the training activity as a frontal session university-like ,pedagogy
The teachers can monitor students’progress through Jenkins,pedagogy
provide detailed instructions within the activity for both the command line interface and the graphical interface,pedagogy
feedback mechanism in our delivery server do not have the same quality as personal interaction because they are asynchronous and in written form,pedagogy
We push students to stop being consumers of tools and instead become DevOps architects able to identify what is necessary and how tools from the state of practice can be assembled to support a given project,tools
They will need to familiarize themselves with the technologies before the start of the activity,tools
The design of the system is meant to be simple,tools
Automatic tools are thus demanded to facilitate project data collection and analysis,tools
We designed various automatically generated reports to provide timely feedback to students customers and TAs,tools
ALECCS can automatically check the submitted codes so that students (as individual or team member) can check the results and correct their projects quickly,tools
ALECSS is also useful to reduce manual checking load of the teacher ALECSS automatically detects much more warnings than manual checking,tools
The analysis that led to choosing Docker as virtualization engine turned out to be correct,tools
Amazon Web Services (AWS) would remedy high computer power need by porting the test and production environment the Amazon Cloud ,tools
students to gain familiarity with the command line interface for version control before beginning the activity,tools
