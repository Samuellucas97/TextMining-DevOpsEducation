Challenge,Theme
Teaching DevOps mindset is difficult to assess,assessment
to evaluate students' work using realistic environment used by is difficult,assessment
DevOps increases evaluation workload for teachers,assessment
students quit the course because of evaluation,assessment
assessement of previous students knowledge on agile was not good,assessment
Automated assessment of programming exercises is hard,assessment
the automated assessment elaboration take time,assessment
assessment of complex exercises were done with code review instead of system execution,assessment
the ‘no deadline’ meant that the in-coming queue late in the course contained submissions from all iterations,assessment
the ‘unlimited submission’ strategy had the unfortunate consequence of sloppy submissions,assessment
Wasted much time with trivial errors unrelated to the actual exercise solution,assessment
limited research in teaching DevOps,classes preparation
There is little research into effective teaching pratices for incorporating DevOps into traditional software engineer courses,classes preparation
lack of a proper and sound theory of DevOps,classes preparation
DevOps has not yet standardized with the Software Engineerigin Body of Knowledge,classes preparation
educators need to be conscious about when planning and conducting their teaching,classes preparation
the teaching staff had to invest a non-negligible time in the preparation of the course,classes preparation
the questionnaire may have been ambiguous in some parts and possibly too generic,classes preparation
spend considerable amount of time collecting information on-site about the teams and technologies they used,classes preparation
unable to collect information because of corporate privacy,classes preparation
Bilateral previous communication with teams is not always possible or facilitated,classes preparation
DevOps still received minor attention in higher education,curriculum
curricula is still outdated,curriculum
courses teach “Dev” rather than “Ops”,curriculum
Devops mindset should be considered to fine tune curricula,curriculum
Teaching DevOps is multidisciplinary and therefore crosscutting the traditional course boundaries,curriculum
students prerequisite was insufficient,curriculum
high effort vs course ECTS,curriculum
students quit the course because of workload,curriculum
The little time available to teaching complexities of CD and CI,curriculum
It was shot time frame (two weeks) in 125 hours for students' workload,curriculum
the time available to teach CD and CI is devoted to other concepts,curriculum
CD and related concepts are complex,devops concepts
students have difficulties in explaining IaC,devops concepts
teach DevOps mindset / cultural,devops concepts
trade-off between teaching practice (technological stacks) and theoric (principles and pillars),devops concepts
Universities need to explore feasible ways to keep up with the technological development in a way that allows them concentrate on fundamentals and underpinning theories,devops concepts
teachers need to learn operations,devops concepts
teachers need to learn dev and opt activities,devops concepts
the main challenge was to find ways of emphasizing the Ops part of the approach,devops concepts
The mutation testing pipeline is not perceived by students as useful,devops concepts
Creating a (semi) realistic environment for students to practice within is not trivial,environment setup
initial setup is complicated,environment setup
DevOps requires complex and laborious architectures,environment setup
virtualization environments are laborious and complex,environment setup
maintaining the virtual environment increase costs,environment setup
setup the tools and workflows increases the effort for educators,environment setup
contraints problems with cloud service and institutional security policies,environment setup
hard time to get into the project’s subject,pedagogy
very hard work to get the project done,pedagogy
The difficulty is to find realistic enough projects that students can still handle,pedagogy
it is difficult to work with real project,pedagogy
one fixed project for all students could be boring,pedagogy
difficult to see and control progress of the development of the project,pedagogy
It is very challenging to fairly and timely evaluate and provide feedback to students with diversified projects and limited resources of lecturers and teaching assistants,pedagogy
Differences between academia and industry education: Learners initial state Learners attitude Pace of education Expectation,pedagogy
Better bridges between education and work are thus needed,pedagogy
toy examples are not enough to understand the subject,pedagogy
unbalance between practical and theoretical work,pedagogy
It was taught in accelerated mode and lacked the depth necessary for a clear understanding of the technologies,pedagogy
how to set up the DevOps approach itself from scratch,pedagogy
students not motivated,pedagogy
Students’ motivation is crucial for a successful DevOps course,pedagogy
DevOps tools are complex,tools
Many DevOps tools for teacher to learn,tools
DevOps tools are new and time-consuming for a universitary lecturer,tools
some devops tools involve learning curve,tools
DevOps overhead of keeping up with the industrial state-of-the-art at universities is often too high,tools
Avoid focusing only on tools,tools
high computing power need can lead to resource-induced problems for computers of students,tools
specific learning tool does not detect all problems,tools
Git tool should be a prerequisite,tools
Static analysis tool lacks of failures when detect possible issues,tools
